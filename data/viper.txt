While the Corvette was considered powerful with 250 hp, and the ZR-1 was incredible with 400 hp, the Viper was outright insane compared to everything else on the road. Back in the day, the car world was weird, as Bob Lutz was president of Chrysler, which owned a little company called Lamborghini. The Italians helped design the aluminum V10 that sat under the Viper's long hood, where it made 400 hp. The Viper wasn't just a Corvette competitor, it was a big step up in performance, and a true resurrection of the legendary Shelby Cobra. If you were at all interested in cars in the 90's, Viper was one of your favorites as it was absolutely insane, but realistically affordable.
