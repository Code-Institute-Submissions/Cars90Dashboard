The final version of the Supra had a point to prove. Born out of the derivative Celica, the 1993 was all rounded corners and turbo boost. The unbelievably strong inline six engine block became a legend, and the car ended up in everything from Need For Speed to The Fast and the Furious.Even if it is a little over-worshipped at times, it's still a 320 hp coupe that's as easy to drive fast is it is comfy to ride in. Certain elements of society never really got over the Supra's demise, which is a big reason why it's perpetually rumored for revival.
