The NSX is relatively unknown outside car enthusiast circles. Most people that don't have an interest in cars see one of these and think it's a Ferrari, which isn't an insult. The '90s were a time when Honda was still fun, and making solid, economical, and relatively exciting cars. The NSX was their take on a supercar, made in peculiar Honda fashion, and it forever changed the game. A mid-mounted naturally aspirated 3.0 liter V6 drove the rear wheels, with choice of auto or manual transmissions. While that doesn't seem all that impressive, Honda managed to wring 275 hp out of it, and with just 3,000 to push, the NSX was quick, handled amazingly well, and proved that supercars could be reliable as everyday cars. Ferrari took notes, which is the true compliment.
