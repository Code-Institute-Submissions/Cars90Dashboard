Lexus debuted in the States for the 1990 model year with a car that would become synonymous with the brand. While the LS was nicely appointed, had a solid interior, a 250 hp V8, and offered a fair price, it was a rather bland looking vehicle. It sold well, by the similar appearing second generation in 1995, these guys were everywhere and Toyota was on their way to being unstoppable. While depreciation finally took its toll and sent these luxury cars to poor neighborhoods, most of them are still running today. The two-tone paint, usually white over silver, will cause flashbacks to the Clinton administration.
