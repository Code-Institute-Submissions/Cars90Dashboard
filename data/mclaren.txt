From 1992 to 1996, just 106 McLaren F1 supercars hit the road. That is a disproportionately low number compared to the car's historical and technological significance. Supercars like the F40 and XJ220 were impressive monsters, but tended to rely on brute power, light weight and extreme aerodynamics. That's fine, but the F1 proved the way for the hypercar, by bringing real F1 racing technology to the street, and making it livable and reliable. 627 hp was unreal in the early 90's, and the rest of the car was equally nuts, including the 24 karat gold engine heat shielding. While it was a low seller, the F1 was the F40 for the '90s, and adorned millions of kid's bedroom walls.
