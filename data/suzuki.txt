This little 4x4 was a hit early on in the mid-'80s. An upgrade in '91 gave it better looks and a fuel injected four cylinder belting out 63 horsepower. That may not sound like much, but the Samurai was rated as a lightweight subcompact, and it actually kept up with traffic. It was brilliant off-road, as the slight weigh, and simple but tough suspension made it easy for n00bz. The Samurai was replaced in 1995 with the X-90, featuring 95 hp and a CD player. Definitely a product of the 1990s, with lots of curves the X-90 looks like a Geo Metro that's trying hard to grow up and be a Wrangler
