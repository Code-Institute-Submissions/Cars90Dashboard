Cadillac started the '90s as the top manufacturer of luxury cars in the world. They ended the '90s in sixth place. The Eldorado exemplified everything that was wrong with Cady at that time. Overweight, and with zero sporting pretensions, the front wheel drive coupe was designed for the Greatest Generation that was rapidly hanging up their keys.
The Cadillac Eldorado is a personal luxury car that was manufactured and marketed by Cadillac from 1952 to 2002 over ten generations. Competitors and similar vehicles included the Lincoln Mark series, Buick Riviera, Oldsmobile Toronado and Chrysler's Imperial Coupe.The Eldorado was at or near the top of the Cadillac line during early model years.
