The right car, at the wrong time. The last generation RX-7 sported 276 horsepower from a smooth 1.3 liter rotary engine. Sequential twin turbos made predictable power and impressive torque, while the light weight and perfect 50:50 weight distribution made one of the best handling cars of the time, at any price. Unfortunately, sales of all sports cars were down, and the rotary had a hard time meeting emissions and mileage figures, so Mazda canned the entire program.
