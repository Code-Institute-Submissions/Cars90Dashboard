While the tenth generation F-150 was produced between 1997 and 2004, this is THE '90s truck. The rounded design was finalized back when the Taurus was the hot seller, and its aero influence is easily seen on this generation's truck. Since we hadn't hit the power and torque wars of the new millennium, output from the 5.4 liter V8 was a pathetic 220 hp. The interior was coated in plastic (also rounded), but no one cared, as Ford would set sales records before the end of the generation.The Lightning first dropped in 1994 as a mildly suped-up pickup truck, but when it was reincarnated in 1999, it was an animal unto its own.
