					<p>The 1990s might not seem too long ago, but it’s worth remembering that period. Still, there are quite a few '90s survivors on the road today, and we’ve drilled down into the data to find out what happened between 1990-'99 and what are the top 10 best cars.</p>

							<h3 class ="title-format car-name">Toyota Supra</h3>
							<p class ="car-description text-format"> The final version of the Supra had a point to prove. Born out of the derivative Celica, the 1993 was all rounded corners and turbo boost. The unbelievably strong inline six engine block became a legend, and the car ended up in everything from Need For Speed to The Fast and the Furious.
							Even if it is a little over-worshipped at times, it's still a 320 hp coupe that's as easy to drive fast is it is comfy to ride in. Certain elements of society never really got over the Supra's demise, which is a big reason why it's perpetually rumored for revival. </p>
							
							<h3 class ="title-format">Final thoughts about this section..</h3>
							<p class="text-format">Looking back, it’s strange how some of the iconic cars from the 1990s are already legends and still hold up well to scrutiny, while others are rather disappointing and deserve to be forgotten. Interesting decade. Do you have a favorite ‘90s car from this list?</p>
